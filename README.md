As seen on Mr.Robot you can hack someone and get his saved passwords in the blink of an eye, but this can't be done without writing a paylod to do so.
I’ve been looking around a few days ago for a payload but the only one i found is in hak5darren github and it’s patched.
In a collaboration with m3dsec we used the Rubber Language Script to get this powerful tool back to life and we wrote 3 scripts:
One against Mozilla Firefox, One against Google Chrome, and one that works against both of the browsers in case you don’t know what’s the target machine browser.
We didn’t stop here, we have made these scripts can steal the NTLM Hash too so you can kill two birds with one stone
